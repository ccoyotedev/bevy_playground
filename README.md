## Mechanics

I want the game to be a simple 2D wave survival game. However I want to use it as a vehicle to learn Rust and refamilirise myself with mathematical concepts.

So the idea of the game will be to shoot and whack enemies.

HOWEVER, borrowing inspiration from Super Smash Bro's, I dont want to use the concept of health. Instead as enemies and the character accumulate damage, the more force is applied to them on each hit. The only way to die or kill enemies is by knocking them into kill zones.
